So, before invoking a linear regression algorithm, ML practitioners convert any non-numeric columns to numbers following some encoding scheme — such as 1-hot encoding. The linear regression SP of Db2 can natively handle nominal columns. When the input table has any nominal column, the SP internally converts it into a set of numeric columns using 1-hot encoding. So, I can leave the three nominal columns — GENDER, MARITAL_STATUS, and PROFESSION — as-is and let the SP take care of them. Now, the GOSALES_TRAIN dataset is ready for model training. Model Training\\nThe following call to the LINEAR_REGRESSION SP will begin training of a linear regression model using training examples from the GOSALES_TRAIN table. The SP will use the list of columns mentioned in the incolum paramter as input features and the column from the target parameter as the output column.',\n",

The following SP call will show the list of existing models in the catalog, which now includes my new model. CALL IDAX.LIST_MODELS('format=short, all=true')\\nAdditionally, the LINEAR_REGRESSION SP saves the learned values of intercept and the coefficients, along with several other learned parameter values, in a table. The table’s name takes this form: MODELNAME_MODEL. For the GOSALES_LINREG model, the name of its metadata table is GOSALES_LINREG_MODEL. The following SQL will display the values of the learned model parameters.

Generating Predictions with the Model In this step, I will use the GOSALES_LINREG model to predict the purchase amount of the customers in the GOSALE_TEST table.
